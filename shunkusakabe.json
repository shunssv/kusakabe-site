  "summary": "My website is created by Next.js. This is for the first time to develop with the framework and React. The most difficult thing to build was making works page dynamically. Although I made the page with local JSON files on behalf of headless CMS, I had faced difficulty for a while.",
  "comment": "I selected Next.js because I wanted to learn modern javascript and framework. I have only experience coding with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript beforehand. The concept of Next.js was very exceptional. I would like to dive into the framework. As next step, I would like to learn Vercel Storage and API, and then build dynamic pages.",
